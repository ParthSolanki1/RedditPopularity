# Predicting Popularity of Reddit Posts

## Abstract

In a society where the success of advertisements is determined by the amount of interaction that a post generates, it is very important to understand when and where to post or comment in order to garner the most interactions. We’re measuring the number of interactions in a post by its score. The goal of this project is to use various features/factors about the post or comment to determine the score that it may generate. We would like to understand what factors lead to having a popular post/comment as opposed to one that is not as popular. Moreover, we’d like to use these factors to also be able to predict the score of posts and comments. Overall, we would like to get a better understanding of user behaviour on reddit when it comes to upvoting various different comments and posts.
